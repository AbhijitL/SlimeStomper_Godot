# Slime stomper.
A prototype top down platformer type game made using Godot 3.5.1.It's a prototype for a game jam. 

Most of the assets are made from scratch except the UI element and font which is from a free site.

I may still do development even tho the game jam is already finished and i couldn't submit in a week.
