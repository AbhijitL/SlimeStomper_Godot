# Slime stomper.
A prototype top down platformer type game made using Godot 3.5.1.It's a prototype for a game jam. 

Most of the assets are made from scratch except the UI element and font which is from a free site.

I may still do development even tho the game jam is already finished and i couldn't submit in a week.

# Adding level to the game.
Inherit the template_level and make the level design as your wish place the player anywhere,set the camera, add enemies and so on. 
For now you have to put that level scene path to levelselector scene and the level before.
